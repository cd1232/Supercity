# Supercity
 
SuperCity was originally a prototype developed in Unity and C# in 1 week by a team of 2 programmers, 3 artists, and 1 sound engineer. This prototype was taken further in mini-production and worked on for another 4 weeks.

The team included myself, Eloise Carr, Calliope Ryder (@callioperyder), Ben Walden, Jacob Copper, and Chris Hodgson.

The gameplay consists of managing callouts to different types of problems the city’s citizens may face. Problems are split into 4 different categories, and the player has 2 contractors in each category that they may send to jobs. Players must respond to jobs before they turn red, as citizens will get angry and the city’s happiness will go down.

Each time a player survives a day, they may choose an upgrade from different options, some including increasing the speed at which a contractor will finish a job, and making a section of Auckland get angry slower.
